# Decision log

Choices that could have gone another way, with the option not taken and why. Appended to as
the build goes. This log is a deliverable.

Format: date, what was decided, what else was on the table, why this one.

## 2026-08-23. Repo layout follows section 7 literally

Created `data/raw`, `data/processed`, `src/fit`, `src/model`, `src/optimise`, `src/export`,
`tests` and `web` exactly as the brief names them, with `src` and its subpackages as importable
Python packages. Each `__init__.py` carries a docstring saying what belongs in that directory,
so the layout does not drift from the brief silently.

Alternative considered: a flatter `src/` with modules rather than subpackages, which is less
ceremony for a project this size. Rejected because the brief already fixed these names and
matching them keeps the case study, the brief and the tree readable against each other.

`data/raw` and `data/processed` are committed with `.gitkeep` files and nothing under `data/`
is gitignored. Raw downloads are committed on purpose so the pipeline reproduces from a clean
clone.

## 2026-08-23. statsmodels rather than scikit-learn for the fits

The brief allows either. Picked statsmodels.

Section 6 requires perturbing fitted coefficients across their confidence intervals to render
the frontier as a band, and section 4.1 requires plotting the path of a rolling-window
elasticity. statsmodels returns standard errors, confidence intervals and the regression
diagnostics needed to say whether a fit is bad, which section 4 and the working rules both
demand. scikit-learn returns point estimates and would mean bootstrapping the intervals by
hand.

Cost of the choice: scikit-learn would have been the better tool if the premium relationship
turns out to need regularisation or a non-parametric form. If that happens, revisit.

## 2026-08-23. Two dependencies beyond the named stack

The working rules cap dependencies at pymoo, numpy, pandas, a fitting library and Plotly
without a logged reason. Two additions.

`requests`, for scripting the data.gov.sg datastore API pulls named in section 8. The
alternative is `urllib` from the standard library, which works but makes retry and error
handling on a flaky public API more code than it saves. `requests` is already an indirect
dependency of the resolved tree.

`pytest`, to run the section 5.4 validation suite. The alternative is `unittest` from the
standard library. Picked pytest for parametrised cases, which the ZDT1 and DTLZ2 checks and the
sensitivity sweep will both want.

Neither is a modelling dependency. Neither introduces a coefficient or a functional form.

## 2026-08-23. Direct dependencies pinned to resolved versions, no lockfile

`requirements.txt` pins the seven direct dependencies to the versions that resolved on
2026-08-23 under Python 3.11. Transitive dependencies, including scipy and matplotlib pulled in
by pymoo and statsmodels, float.

Alternative considered: a full `pip freeze` lockfile, which is stricter reproduction. Rejected
for now because the direct pins already fix every version a result depends on, and a lockfile
is one more file to keep honest across three weeks. If a numeric result turns out to move
between transitive versions, that is the reason to add one.
